      A Qust score can consist of one or more blocks (or musicaly speaking voices) which are marked at their beginning by a <code>&gt;</code>.<br>
      At the toplevel of a score the window size (W:width x height) and the number of boxes (S:column x row) are defined:
      <pre>W:800x800&S:8x8</pre>
      or if MIDI is going to be used it should be indicated as well:
      <pre>W:800x800&S:8x8&MD</pre>
      Now initialize the first block and give it an initial tempo (<code>BPM</code>) and an initial color (<code>R</code> = red, <code>G</code> = green, <code>B</code> = blue). You can gain different colors by setting RGB parameters of a color (values 0 - 255). These parameters can be reset later at any time during the piece. At the end of the assignments terminate the line with a <code>;</code>:
    </p>
    <pre>&gt;BPM:120&R:255&G:100&B:15;</pre>
    <p>In the next lines write the instructions for the boxes, with <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> indicating which box is off or on. In this example having <code>8x8</code> boxes a single state (musical pulse) would look something like:</p>
    <pre>
00000000
00000001
00000010
00000011
00000100
00000101
00000110
00000111*
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that with the exception of the very last state, each state should terminate with a <code>*</code>. An example of changning the tempo after each single state at runtime would look like:</p>
    <pre>
&gt;
BPM:60;
00000000
00000001
00000010
00000011
00000100
00000101
00000110
00000111*
BPM:90;
00000000
00000001
00000010
00000011
00000100
00000101
00000110
00000111*
BPM:135;
00000000
00000001
00000010
00000011
00000100
00000101
00000110
00000111*
BPM:203;
00000000
00000001
00000010
00000011

00000101
00000110
00000111

      MIDI information come after each raw of a state. Each light box (<code>1</code>) will be associated with a single MIDI message which are read from left to right as pitch+velocity (at this time only these two parameter are supported). MIDI information which can not be associated and mapped to any light boxes are not processed. A pipeline should separate a raw from it's MIDI information.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the following example a successive lights of a 1x8 grid are mapped to midi numbers
      60, 64, 67, 71, 76, 80, 85, 90 and 96 with each note having a velocity of 100:</p>
    <pre>
S:8x1&W:800x100&MD

&gt;BPM:60&R:255;
10000000|60&100*
01000000|64&100*
00100000|67&100*
00010000|71&100*
00001000|76&100*
00000100|80&100*
00000010|85&100*
00000001|90&100*
00000001|96&100
    </pre>
    <p>Having more than one light in a raw it will be interpreted as a chord by assigning appropriate number of pitches+velocities.

This is shown in the following example where lights are mapped from left to right order
to pitches and velocities. Note that a plus sign <code>+</code> is used for expressing simultaneous
      pitches and velocities:</p>
    <pre>
S:8x1&W:800x100&MD

&gt;BPM:60&R:255;
10000001|60+96&60+120*
01000010|64+90&65+110*
00100100|67+85&71+101*
00011000|71+80&78+92*
R:0&B:255;
00011000|76+76&85+85*
00100100|80+71&92+78*
01000010|85+67&101+71*
10000001|90+64&110+65*
10000001|96+60&120+60
