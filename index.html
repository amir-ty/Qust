    <h1>QUST</h1>
    <h2>(Quadratstudie)</h2>
    <p>
      Qust is a small DSL for composing visual rhythmic pieces. It is written in Python 2.7 and uses <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">Pygame</a> and <a href="https://spotlightkid.github.io/python-rtmidi/index.html">rtmidi</a> for rendering graphics and sending MIDI messages.<br>
      It was written for demonstrating a musical Domain Specific Language to the to-be music students of the Kulturakademie for the occasion of the 2nd Creative Week at the Music University Karlsruhe. The course took place on March the 6th, 2019 at the Institute of Music Informatics and Musicology, where students designed and composed small visual/acoustical pieces with the help of qust.<br>
      Qust allows flexible control over temporal musical aspects at run-time, which makes the realisation of fairly complex musical structures possible. For an introduction see it's <a href="manual.html">manual</a>.
